# Rust Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a Rust equivalent to [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) (section ["Intermediate Algorithm Scripting"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting)).

## Install

First clone the repository to your desired destination:

```
git clone git@github.com:3rfaan/rust_algorithms.git && cd rust_algorithms
```

Then you can run the following command while in the folder `rust_algorithms`:

```
cargo run
```

There will be a list of all exercises in the same order as on the FCC website. You can then enter the number of the exercise you want to see the tests. If you want to see the result of all tests just type in `all`. To exit the program type `0`.
